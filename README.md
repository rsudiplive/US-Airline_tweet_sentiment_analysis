# US-Airline_tweet_sentiment_analysis

This notebook is to expand our understanding of tweet sentiment in the airline industry.

Here, we are given a data of US Airline tweets and their sentiment. The task is to do sentiment analysis about the problems of each major U.S. airline. Twitter data was scraped from February of 2015 and contributors were asked to first classify positive, negative, and neutral tweets, followed by categorizing negative reasons (such as "late flight" or "rude service").

Performed data-preparation steps, feature engineering, detailed EDA and applied some NLP/text-preprocessing techniques to derive meaningful insights out of the text data containing tweets from US-Airlines. There are several other methods like using pre-trained models and transformers which can save a lot of time and resources compared to training a model from scratch..

Also leveraged the use of RNN architecture with LSTM units for tweet sentiment analysis. This is performed in a seperate notebook which is attached in the main branch for this repository.
